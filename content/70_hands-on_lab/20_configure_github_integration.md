In order for JFrog Pipelines to get access to the code in your aws-modernization-with-jfrog repository, we must first set up a Pipelines GitHub integration. This allows Pipelines to authenticate and get access to your GitHub repositories. To do this, we create a GitHub Personal Access Token with the correct permissions.

JFrog Pipelines can also integrate with other source code repositories such as GitHub Enterprise, BitBucket and GitLab.

4. Configure the token for the following scopes.

```
* repo (all)

* admin:public_key (read, write)
```
5. Click **Generate token**.
6. Copy the token.
7. Go to your JFrog Platform instance at _https://[server name].jfrog.io_. Refer to your _JFrog Free Subscription Activation_ email if needed. Substitute your _server name_.
